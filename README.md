# Labs (in order)

### Lab 0 - Gold
This program reads a "map" on standard input. It's really a text file in the following format:
- A period stands for dirt
- A dash stands for a rock with nothing under it
- An upper case letter stands for rock with gold hidden under it. The amount of gold represented by the letter: A stands for one ounce, B stands for two ounces, etc.

### Lab 1 - Checkeboard & Moonglow
A generalized checkerboard is a rectangular grid one that has four parameters:
- R: The number of rows.
- C: The number of columns.
- SC: The starting character.
- CS: The cycle size.

The first four are the parameters R, C, SC and CS, as defined above. The fifth parameter is a width W. Your program should print out the specified checkerboard such that each element of the grid is printed as a (W * W) square. Here are some examples:

UNIX> bin/checkerboard
5 6 a 4 1
- abcdab
- bcdabc
- cdabcd
- dabcda
- abcdab
